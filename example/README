This is an example ShouldNode project.

The idea is that you might cd into this directory, and run:

    node runner.js

This would collect all of the files in test/ match the Regular Expression: 

    *_test.js

Each test case will be loaded, interpreted and executed, and a report will be 
printed while everything progresses and summarized when everything is complete.
